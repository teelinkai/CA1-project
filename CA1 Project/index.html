            <h2>Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts</h2>
        </header>

        <h1 class="maintitle">About the Goal</h1>
        <p>The world is on the brink of a climate catastrophe and current actions and plans to
            address the crisis are insufficient. Without transformative action starting now and
            within this decade to reduce greenhouse gas emissions deeply and rapidly in all
            sectors, the <b>1.5°C target will be at risk</b> and with it the lives of <b>more than 3 billion
            people</b>. Failure to act leads to intensifying <b>heatwaves, droughts, flooding, wildfires,
            sea-level rise, and famines</b>. Emissions should already be decreasing now and will
            need to be cut <b>almost by half by 2030</b> - a mere seven years from now. To combat
            climate change and its impacts by 2030, urgent and transformative action is needed
            to meet the commitments under the Paris Agreement across mitigation and
            adaptation efforts.

            <p>
                The Singapore Green Plan 2030 is a plan released by the Government of Singapore on 10 
                February 2021 that sets targets for sustainability in Singapore by 2030. This <i>"collective 
                whole-of-nation effort"</i> supports Singapore's aim to <b>achieve net zero emissions by 2050.</b>
                The plan is spearheaded by five Ministries, being the Ministry of Education, Ministry of 
                National Development, Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Ministry of Transport 
                and the Ministry of Trade and Industry. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Singapore Green Plan 2030 has five key pillars, 
                being "City in Nature", "Sustainable Living", "Energy Reset", "Green Economy" and "Resilient 
                Future". They will be enabled by a Green Government and Green Citizenry. Green Government 
                involves Singapore’s government embedding sustainability into key business areas (including 
                procurement) setting more ambitious targets for public infrastructure. <b>Green citizenry includes 
                enabling and empowering Singapore residents to get involved in the sustainability journey, 
                working together to enact the Green Plan.</b>
